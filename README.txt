How to get started with the application?


First thing you have to do (after you unzip it) is, take the application folder and place it in xampp/htdocs directory.

Open Xampp and 'start' Apache.

Open up any Web browser and enter 'localhost' into the address box. The browser will open a list of files stored under the 'htdocs' folder on your computer. Click on the name of the application's folder (assignment1) to open and run it.

How to use the application?


When you first open it, you will see three buttons, Student, Courses and Upload.

If you click 'Student', a page with the total number of students and a table with each student's data will show up. Students are sorted according to their GPA in descending order. The order can be changed to ascending by clicking on 'GPA'. You can do the same thing to each column by clicking on the name of it.

The 'Courses' button displays you the total number of unique courses and a table with information about each course. Courses are sorted in ascending order with respect to the number of students registered in it. But you can change the order here as well.

'Upload' takes you to the page where you can upload new data from a file. First you have to choose the file from your computer and then click 'Upload File'. A table with the new data will appear.
